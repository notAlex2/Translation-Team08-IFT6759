## Instructions for the team:


### Coding Standards

* Lint your code as per PEP8 before submitting a pull request
* Add comments and doc-strings to your code
* Pull requests are required for merging to master for major changes
* Use your own branch for major work, don't use master
* No large files allowed in git
* Mark task in progress on Kanban before starting work

### K-Fold Strategy

* As we had small aligned dataset of 11k examples, we decided to use single-fold validation held out strategy.

### To setup a new local environment:

```console
module load python/3.7
virtualenv ../local_env
source ../local_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_local.txt
```

### To setup a new server node environment:

```console
module load python/3.7
virtualenv ../server_env --no-download
source ../server_env/bin/activate
pip install --no-index -r requirements.txt
```
OR, if no requirement.txt file is available:
```console
pip install --no-index tensorflow-gpu==2 pandas numpy tqdm
```
